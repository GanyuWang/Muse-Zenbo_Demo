# Muse-Zenbo_Demo

This project shows how to connect Muse and Zenbo. You can find the corresponding app "bcitest2" in one of the Zenbo in our lab. 
If correctly connecting Muse and Zenbo, the robot will show faical expression change according to the data receiving from the robot. 

The most useful files are in Muse-Zenbo_Demo/app/src/main/java/com/example/wgy/bcitest2/. Their functions are shown by name. 

Be aware that the update of the facial expressions of the robot is driven by receiving data from Muse (connectMuse.java#81).
